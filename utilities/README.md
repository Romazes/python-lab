# Utilities

This directory contains utility functions, helper modules, and reusable code.

## Purpose

- Provide common functionality used across scripts and experiments
- Centralize helper functions
- Reduce code duplication

## Usage

Import utilities as needed:
```python
from utilities import helper_module
```

Each utility module should be well-documented with clear function signatures and docstrings.
